# Opticks Test in React

## Welcome

Welcome to Opticks' Dashboard & Fraud Analysis app. This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository by copying the `ssh` url. This is provided by Github on the green, `Code` button of this repository website. If you prefer it, you can also clone it through `https` url, although `ssh` is more recommended.
2. Open terminal in your computer and run `git clone ` and the copied url. Make sure you do it on a folder you choose! Navigate through `cd ` + folder name, or make a new directory with `mkdir ` + folder name. In any case, you can always run `pwd` on the same terminal window to know where you are.
3. In the same terminal window, after the clone is finished, go to the cloned folder (`cd opticks-react`) and run `npm i` to install all packages needed for this project.

## Launch

1. Once the installation is done, launch the application with `npm start`. It can be done on the same terminal window that has finished installing the packages.
2. After some seconds, if the launch is successful, a new tab will open on your default browser. If you don't have any React app open at the same time, it will mostly open the app on `localhost:3000`.

## Navigation

1. The app consists of two views: Dashboard and Fraud Analysis. Both views have widgets with numeric & graphic data that will give you an insight of the company's metrics. Inside every view, a selector has been placed to filter the data depending on a date range. For a better experience, make sure you run the app on a desktop environment.

### Original README created by `create-react-app`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
